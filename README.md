## Overview

In Project 4 the team is using machine learning to predict the future prices of beef, rice and coffee. A data set that spanned form 1992 to 2021 was used. It contains price per kilo in USD for each month and each item.

Using Python and SQL the data was cleaned and imported into a database for later use. The team employed supervised machine learning and used Tensorflow for Dense and LSTM to create and optimize models to help us predict the prices of food for 2022.
